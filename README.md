## 🎮 About The Project

This repository showcases my solution for the **XODIA Reinforcement Learning Competition**, where I secured **3rd place** among 30+ participants. The challenge involved developing an AI agent capable of mastering *Pocket Tanks* through optimized reward function engineering and reinforcement learning techniques.

### 🎯 Competition Objectives
- Design an intelligent AI bot for Pocket Tanks
- Implement an optimized reward function
- Compete against other AI agents in various scenarios
- Maximize performance and strategic decision-making

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
```
🐍 Python 3.8+
🤖 Xodia24 (Competition Framework)
🧠 stable-baselines3
🔥 PyTorch
📊 TensorBoard (Monitoring & Visualization)
☁️ Google Colab (Training Environment)
```


## 🧮 Reward Function Architecture

Our sophisticated reward system employs advanced mathematical modeling to optimize agent behavior:

1. **Advanced Mathematics**
